        "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine holds promise for transformative advancements aimed at improving healthcare outcomes. Amidst this promise, AI has been envisioned as a tool to detect and mitigate racial and ethnic inequity known to plague current cardiovascular care. However, this enthusiasm is dampened by the recognition that AI itself can harbor and propagate biases, necessitating a careful approach to ensure equity. This review highlights topics in the landscape of AI in cardiology, its role in identifying and addressing healthcare inequities, promoting diversity in research, concerns surrounding its applications, and proposed strategies for fostering equitable utilization. RECENT FINDINGS: Artificial intelligence has proven to be a valuable tool for clinicians in diagnosing and mitigating racial and ethnic inequities in cardiology, as well as the promotion of diversity in research. This promise is counterbalanced by the cautionary reality that AI can inadvertently perpetuate existent biases stemming from limited diversity in training data, inherent biases within datasets, and inadequate bias detection and monitoring mechanisms. Recognizing these concerns, experts emphasize the need for rigorous efforts to address these limitations in the development and deployment of AI within medicine. SUMMARY: Implementing AI in cardiovascular care to identify and address racial and ethnic inequities requires careful design and execution, beginning with meticulous data collection and a thorough review of training datasets. Furthermore, ensuring equitable performance involves rigorous testing and continuous surveillance of algorithms. Lastly, the promotion of diversity in the AI workforce and engagement of stakeholders are crucial to the advancement of equity to ultimately realize the potential for artificial intelligence for cardiovascular health equity.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Digital Health Records (DHR) have become essential for managing patient data, including radiology and nuclear medicine reports. The wider adoption of DHR globally presents an opportunity to improve patient engagement and empowerment through effective access and sharing of imaging investigations. This review aims to synthesize literature on views, experiences, expectations, and preferences of oncology patients and healthcare professionals (HCP) when accessing imaging via DHR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This review was conducted using recommended Cochrane Handbook databases (registration: CRD42021213808), focusing on English articles published from 2000 onwards. Three experienced reviewers critically appraised selected articles, thematic analysis and narrative synthesis were used to extract data. RESULTS: 493 unique articles were identified, with 451 excluded, resulting in 42 articles assessed for eligibility. Nine studies were included, eight from the USA, one from Canada, published between 2010 and 2020. Findings suggest patient portals can positively impact patient and HCP engagement, and patients desire access to their imaging reports. Factors such as timing of access, adequate consultation time, resources for HCP to discuss findings, and format of information are critical considerations that influence both patient and HCP perceptions and preferences.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of childhood blindness. It predominantly affects preterm infants with very low birth weights or extreme prematurity. Aberrant retinal vascular development, driven by hyperoxia and hypoxia-induced neovascularization, is central to ROP pathogenesis. This review explores the relationship between maternal health and ROP, evaluates current prevention strategies, assesses innovations in diagnostic and screening technologies, reviews contemporary treatments, and identifies future research directions. METHODS: A literature review was conducted in the PubMed / MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases using related keywords, i.e., \"retinopathy of prematurity,\" \"retinal development,\" \"pathophysiology,\" \"vascular growth,\" \"complications,\" \"visual outcomes,\" \"maternal health factors,\" \"obstetrics,\" \"preeclampsia,\" \"risk factors,\" \"preterm birth,\" \"corticosteroids,\" \"oxygen management,\" \"treatment strategies,\" \"laser therapy,\" \"anti-VEGF agents,\" \"surgical approaches\", and \"artificial intelligence (AI)\" and targeting English studies published in the last 20 years. Additionally, the references from the selected articles were manually reviewed. Clinical trials, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, case-control studies, case series, narrative reviews, pilot studies, and relevant animal studies were included. RESULTS: Maternal factors, such as diabetes, smoking, and preeclampsia, along with neonatal factors, such as low gestational age and extreme prematurity, are critical contributors to ROP. Key preventative strategies to reduce the risk of ROP and improve neonatal outcomes include: 1. prenatal care involves screening and managing maternal conditions, providing maternal education, and administering antenatal corticosteroids. 2. Neonatal care encompasses nutritional support, supplementation with essential fatty acids, and regulated oxygen administration. By focusing on these strategies, we can enhance the health of newborns at risk for ROP. Advances in screening, including artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted diagnostics and advanced imaging, are improving early detection. Treatment modalities such as laser photocoagulation, cryotherapy, and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapies have shown promise but pose challenges, including recurrence risk and systemic side effects. CONCLUSIONS: ROP continues to pose a major threat to the vision of preterm infants, particularly in regions with limited healthcare resources. Addressing ROP requires multidisciplinary team approaches that integrate obstetric and neonatal care. Preventative strategies, including prenatal care optimization, oxygen management, and nutritional support, are essential. Future efforts should focus on integrating emerging technologies and recent findings to ensure global relevance and currency.",

        "title": "Predictive Analytics in Cardiothoracic Care: Enhancing Outcomes with the Healthcare Enabled by Artificial Intelligence in Real Time (HEART) Project.",
        "abstract": "PROBLEM: Postoperative complications after cardiac surgery significantly impact both the short-term and long-term survival of patients. Cardiovascular diseases are a major health concern, accounting for 12% of health expenditures in the United States. A substantial number of patients with cardiovascular disease undergo invasive procedures, including cardiac surgery, and the incidence of postoperative complications is notable. This information underscores the need to effectively prevent postoperative adverse events to improve outcomes, reduce morbidity, shorten hospital stays, and lower health care costs. APPROACH: The Healthcare Enabled by Artificial Intelligence in Real Time (HEART) project is a collaborative effort involving clinicians from MaineHealth, industry experts from Nihon Kohden, and data scientists from the Roux Institute. The project aims to develop a real-time predictive analytics model as a decision support tool for clinicians in the cardiothoracic intensive care unit who care for patients after cardiac surgery. The team is using a supervised, closed-loop, machine learning design to train the model. The initiative involves collecting static and dynamic preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables from a cohort of patients undergoing cardiac surgery at Maine Medical Center. These variables, including data on blood product transfusions and inotropic and vasoactive medications administered, are being transmitted from the electronic health record to a data warehouse. The model will predict the following adverse outcomes: acute kidney injury, renal failure, new onset postoperative atrial fibrillation, prolonged ventilation, reoperation, operative mortality, delirium, stroke, deep sternal wound infection, and extended hospital length of stay. OUTCOMES: The HEART team successfully established a data-collecting infrastructure. Data collection and validation are ongoing, with an emphasis on accuracy and completeness. NEXT STEPS: The project will advance by developing a user-friendly, real-time interface, incorporating feedback from clinicians in the operating room and cardiothoracic intensive care unit to ensure practicality and acceptance of the technology. This interface will provide adverse outcome predictions in real time, support clinical decision-making, and become a regular part of patient care.",

        "content": "Title: Predictive Analytics in Cardiothoracic Care: Enhancing Outcomes with the Healthcare Enabled by Artificial Intelligence in Real Time (HEART) Project.\nAuthors: Felistas Mazhude, Robert S Kramer, Anne Hicks, Qingchu Jin, Melanie Tory, Jaime B Rabb, Mahsan Nourani, Douglas B Sawyer, Raimond L Winslow\nAbstract: PROBLEM: Postoperative complications after cardiac surgery significantly impact both the short-term and long-term survival of patients. Cardiovascular diseases are a major health concern, accounting for 12% of health expenditures in the United States. A substantial number of patients with cardiovascular disease undergo invasive procedures, including cardiac surgery, and the incidence of postoperative complications is notable. This information underscores the need to effectively prevent postoperative adverse events to improve outcomes, reduce morbidity, shorten hospital stays, and lower health care costs. APPROACH: The Healthcare Enabled by Artificial Intelligence in Real Time (HEART) project is a collaborative effort involving clinicians from MaineHealth, industry experts from Nihon Kohden, and data scientists from the Roux Institute. The project aims to develop a real-time predictive analytics model as a decision support tool for clinicians in the cardiothoracic intensive care unit who care for patients after cardiac surgery. The team is using a supervised, closed-loop, machine learning design to train the model. The initiative involves collecting static and dynamic preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables from a cohort of patients undergoing cardiac surgery at Maine Medical Center. These variables, including data on blood product transfusions and inotropic and vasoactive medications administered, are being transmitted from the electronic health record to a data warehouse. The model will predict the following adverse outcomes: acute kidney injury, renal failure, new onset postoperative atrial fibrillation, prolonged ventilation, reoperation, operative mortality, delirium, stroke, deep sternal wound infection, and extended hospital length of stay. OUTCOMES: The HEART team successfully established a data-collecting infrastructure. Data collection and validation are ongoing, with an emphasis on accuracy and completeness. NEXT STEPS: The project will advance by developing a user-friendly, real-time interface, incorporating feedback from clinicians in the operating room and cardiothoracic intensive care unit to ensure practicality and acceptance of the technology. This interface will provide adverse outcome predictions in real time, support clinical decision-making, and become a regular part of patient care.\nURL: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40051776/",
