        "title": "Rating the Efficacy of Diagnostic Imaging Studies Conducted for the Workup of Musculoskeletal Tumors.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Concerns for missed diagnoses have led to increased ordering of diagnostic imaging. Patients with suspected musculoskeletal tumors may undergo nondiagnostic and unnecessary imaging studies before referral to a musculoskeletal oncologist. This can result in patients receiving excessive radiation exposures, accruing unnecessary costs, delays in treatment, and an unnecessary burden on healthcare systems. PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were to (1) internally rate the usefulness of imaging tests completed for musculoskeletal oncology patients undergoing evaluation using a novel scoring system, (2) determine the inter-rater reliability of providers who rated imaging tests, and (3) assess the costs incurred for imaging studies based on Medicare reimbursement rates. METHODS: A single-center, retrospective study was conducted on 112 patients who presented to our musculoskeletal oncology clinic for workup of a suspected mass from February 2021 to May 2021. After obtaining institutional review board approval, information regarding all radiographic images pertinent to the patient's workup was collected through a manual chart review. Patient information and images were sent to six fellowship-trained physicians for review. Providers then graded the appropriateness of each study using a five-point rating system. Final diagnoses were divided into three categories: bone lesions, soft-tissue lesions, and metastatic skeletal lesions. Inter-rater reliability was assessed using interclass correlation coefficient tests. The cost of wasteful tests was calculated using Medicare reimbursement rates. RESULTS: Three hundred twenty-two imaging studies conducted on 112 patients were included in the study. For primary bone lesions, plain radiographs and MRI scans with and without contrast were the highest rated diagnostic studies. For soft-tissue lesions, MRI and CT scans without contrast were the highest rated diagnostic studies. For metastatic bone lesions, positron emission tomography/CT and MRI scans with and without contrast were highly rated diagnostic studies. For all tumor types, core needle biopsy was the highest rated invasive study. The overall interclass correlation coefficient between all providers was 0.33. 1.2% of studies ordered by our department were considered wasteful, accounting for around $1,775 (2.3%) of costs. CONCLUSION: Our study was conducted to internally rate the usefulness of imaging tests ordered for patients who presented to a musculoskeletal oncology clinic. For all tumor types, MRI, CT, and plain radiographs were frequently rated as helpful studies. Core needle biopsy was the highest rated invasive study. Bone scans were considered of limited utility for most bone lesions. The quantity of wasteful studies was low overall. Our study demonstrates the complexity in obtaining appropriate diagnostic imaging for the evaluation of musculoskeletal tumors.",

In the current study, we compiled an overview on the state of fertility preservation (FP) care and limitations for childhood cancer patients throughout the Nordic-Baltic region. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In partnership with the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, an anonymous survey was conducted among 23 major pediatric oncology centers in Nordic and Baltic countries. The survey featured 22 multiple-choice and open-ended questions that provided insights into guidelines, available FP options, clinical indications, and counseling. RESULTS: The response rate to the questionnaire was 74% (17 of 23 pediatric oncology centers). The survey revealed that only 65% of the centers have national guidelines on FP at the time. Although all centers offer counseling before treatment by oncologists (88%) or gynecologists (65%), 76% of the centers provide it only to those fulfill inclusion criteria. Additionally, counseling is unavailable for some patients because of age (35%), communication issues (29%), or lack of time (24%). Predominantly, sperm cryopreservation is offered across all centers for pubertal boys, while testicular tissue cryopreservation is provided at 41% of pediatric oncology centers for prepubertal boys. Oocyte cryopreservation is offered to pubertal girls at 88% of the centers, and ovarian tissue cryopreservation is offered to prepubertal and pubertal girls at 82% of the questioned centers. CONCLUSION: The survey highlights the implementation of FP services status in the Nordic and Baltic countries. However, standardizing FP indications and disseminating guidelines widely is crucial to reduce clinical variability. Addressing issues such as inconsistent counseling, limited collaboration, and unclear risk stratification can drive further improvements.",

CONCLUSION: The survey highlights the implementation of FP services status in the Nordic and Baltic countries. However, standardizing FP indications and disseminating guidelines widely is crucial to reduce clinical variability. Addressing issues such as inconsistent counseling, limited collaboration, and unclear risk stratification can drive further improvements.\nURL: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40184573/",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are treated in low-resource settings have inferior outcomes compared with those in high-resource settings. Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, when combined with chemotherapy, improves overall survival (OS) for DLBCL. However, in part due to the limited availability of infusion centers in low-resource countries, rituximab is rarely used. Subcutaneous rituximab (sqR) is a potential solution; however, its safety and efficacy have not been tested in low-income countries. METHODS: This open-label phase I study enrolled patients 18 years or older with newly diagnosed DLBCL. The first cohort (n = 6) received intravenous rituximab plus CHOP. This cohort received sqR for subsequent cycles. The second cohort (n = 12) received sqR plus CHOP for all cycles. Safety and tolerability were evaluated; secondary outcomes included response rates and treatment completion. RESULTS: Between October 25, 2019, and October 7, 2022, 18 patients, with a median age of 36.5 years, were enrolled; 10 were male, and 10 presented with advanced-stage disease. The most common hematologic toxicity was neutropenia (n = 9, 50%). Fifteen of the 18 participants completed treatment; 14 (93.3%) patients achieved a complete response, and one patient (6.7%) had a partial response. The OS and progression-free survival (PFS) at 12 months were 83% (95% CI, 68 to 100) and 67% (95% CI, 48 to 92), respectively. The OS and PFS at 24 months were 66% (95% CI, 47 to 92) and 67% (95% CI, 48 to 92), respectively. CONCLUSION: As demonstrated in other parts of the world, sqR together with CHOP was safe, well-tolerated, and efficacious among Ugandan patients with DLBCL. The very high OS rates are nearly double those of historical controls and comparable with outcomes expected in resource-rich settings. This study demonstrated the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of sqR-CHOP, increased the research infrastructure in Uganda, and will improve care in other resource-limited settings.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Sub-Saharan Africa carries one of the highest burdens of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the world, with hepatitis B virus (HBV) as the most common cause. Studies in several regions of the world suggest important cancer differences in rural versus urban settings, but limited studies have been performed in Africa. METHODS: We performed a scoping review and pooled analysis of studies on HCC in Africa. Using land use data from the European Space Agency, we calculated the distance in kilometers from each study site to the nearest rural area. Regression models were fit to estimate the association between distance to the nearest rural area and HBV, sex, and weighted mean age. RESULTS: Data from 57 studies including 10,907 patients across 36 towns/cities were included in our analysis. Proximity to rural areas was associated with a higher frequency of HBV-associated HCC in assessment of distance both at midpoint and at quartiles after controlling for country: risk ratio (RR) 1.71 (95% CI, 1.52 to 1.93) and RR 1.51 (95% CI, 1.25 to 1.84), respectively. No association was found between sex and proximity to a rural area: RR 1.02 (95% CI, 0.96 to 1.08). The weighted mean age across the four distance quartiles was 50.09, 53.43, 47.98, and 53.35 years with no statistically significant difference found across the quartiles ( CONCLUSION: Individuals living in rural Africa have a higher rate of HBV-related HCC compared with other liver diseases.

Proximity to rural areas was associated with a higher frequency of HBV-associated HCC in assessment of distance both at midpoint and at quartiles after controlling for country: risk ratio (RR) 1.71 (95% CI, 1.52 to 1.93) and RR 1.51 (95% CI, 1.25 to 1.84), respectively. No association was found between sex and proximity to a rural area: RR 1.02 (95% CI, 0.96 to 1.08). The weighted mean age across the four distance quartiles was 50.09, 53.43, 47.98, and 53.35 years with no statistically significant difference found across the quartiles ( CONCLUSION: Individuals living in rural Africa have a higher rate of HBV-related HCC compared with other liver diseases. Increased HBV awareness efforts in these areas should be considered.\nURL: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40184566/",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to differentiate nonscheduled visits (NSVs) in an outpatient palliative care setting that are driven by or accompanied by uncontrolled symptoms from those that are administrative or routine, such as prescription refills and examination readings. A small language model (SLM) was used to enhance the detection and management of symptoms, thus improving health care resource allocation. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 25,867 patient visits to an outpatient palliative care unit, including 7,036 NSVs. A stratified random sample of 384 NSVs was reviewed to determine the presence of symptoms, using physician audits as the gold standard. A Phi-3-based SLM was validated against these audits to assess its accuracy in detecting the symptoms. The validated SLM was then applied to the entire NSV data set to identify symptom patterns. Multivariate linear regression was used to analyze the association of age, cancer type, and insurance category with the presence of symptoms. RESULTS: SLM demonstrated high sensitivity (99.4%) and accuracy (95.3%) in identifying symptom-driven NSVs. The analysis revealed that 85.7% of the NSVs were driven by symptoms, indicating a significant hidden burden of unmanaged symptoms. The study found that certain demographic and clinical factors, including younger age groups and specific cancer types, were significantly associated with an increased symptom burden. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the substantial burden of symptom-driven NSVs in palliative care and demonstrates the effectiveness of using a SLM to identify and manage symptoms. Implementing such models in clinical practice can improve patient care by optimizing the allocation of health care resources and tailoring interventions to the needs of patients with advanced illnesses.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Despite limited RCTs, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) shows promise for resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma (rPAC). Few prospective results are available on completing the full therapeutic sequence and oncologic outcomes with NAC. METHODS: The PANACHE01-PRODIGE48 phase II trial randomly assigned 153 patients with rPAC (2:2:1) to four cycles of NAC (modified leucovorin, fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin [mFOLFIRINOX], arm 1; leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin [FOLFOX], arm 2) or up-front surgery (control) across 28 French centers (February 2017-July 2020). The primary objective was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of these NAC regimens. Two binary primary end points included 1-year overall survival (OS) postrandomization and the rate of patients completing the full therapeutic sequence. Event-free survival (EFS) assessed time to failure, defined as progression before surgery, unresectable/metastatic disease at surgery, recurrence, or death. RESULTS: The primary objective was achieved for arm 1. In the intention-to-treat population, 70.8% (90% CI, 60.8 to 79.6) and 68% (90% CI, 55.5 to 78.8) completed the therapeutic sequence in arm 1 and arm 2, respectively. Within 12 months postrandomization, 84.3% (90% CI, 75.3 to 90.9) and 71.4% (90% CI, 59.0 to 81.8) of the patients were alive in arm 1 and arm 2, respectively. Treatment was safe and well-tolerated in both NAC arms. Arm 2 was stopped after interim analysis for lack of efficacy (H0 rejection for 1-year OS). One-year EFS rates were 51.4% (95% CI, 41.0 to 64.3), 43.1% (95% CI, 31.3 to 59.5), and 38.7% (95% CI, 24.1 to 62.0) in arm 1, arm 2, and control arm, respectively. CONCLUSION: The feasibility and efficacy of mFOLFIRINOX in the perioperative setting are confirmed concerning therapeutic sequence completion and oncologic outcomes, supporting ongoing trials (PREOPANC3, Alliance AO21806). Further research is needed to identify patients who benefit from NAC (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02959879; EudraCT: 2015-001851-65).",

The objective of this qualitative study was to obtain feedback from stakeholder clinicians and patients about an online interactive tool that was designed to provide information and visualizations of breast cancer symptoms. METHODS: The online Breast Cancer Symptom Explorer tool was developed to allow patients to visualize trajectories for common symptoms associated with tamoxifen and anastrozole using symptom data from the NSABP B35 breast cancer clinical trial. To refine the tool, virtual focus groups were conducted among oncology clinicians and women with a history of breast cancer who had received treatment with an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen, seeking feedback on the tool and its potential usefulness. Discussions took place using a secure web-conferencing platform following a semi-structured interview guide.

        "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a vital role in numerous biological processes. Proteomic research of EVs is crucial for understanding their functions and potential therapeutic implications. Despite many sample preparation protocols for mass spectrometry-based proteomics of EVs being described, the variability in protein extraction across different protocols has not been extensively investigated. Moreover, given the inherent heterogeneity of EVs, it is vital to conduct a thorough evaluation of normalization methods. Here, we present a comprehensive comparison of three widely used lysis agents─sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), urea, and sodium deoxycholate (SDC)─for protein extraction from EVs.

Proteomic research of EVs is crucial for understanding their functions and potential therapeutic implications. Despite many sample preparation protocols for mass spectrometry-based proteomics of EVs being described, the variability in protein extraction across different protocols has not been extensively investigated. Moreover, given the inherent heterogeneity of EVs, it is vital to conduct a thorough evaluation of normalization methods. Here, we present a comprehensive comparison of three widely used lysis agents─sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), urea, and sodium deoxycholate (SDC)─for protein extraction from EVs. We also assess the impact of different normalization strategies on protein quantification, which is crucial for ensuring reliable results. Our results show that method-dependent differences in protein recovery were observed, particularly for membrane-associated proteins. We also find that common normalization strategies, such as urine creatinine and EV markers, did not significantly stabilize protein quantification, indicating that these methods are not universally applicable as normalization standards. Our work thereby provides a reference for the selection of MS sample preparation and normalization strategies for a given EV proteomics project.\nURL: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40184522/",
