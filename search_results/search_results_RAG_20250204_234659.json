        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: With the exception of the FDA-approved valrubicin and pembrolizumab, there are no standard second-line treaments for BCG-unresponsive high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). OBJECTIVES: To provide a systematic review of the novel intravesically administered therapeutic agents for the salvage treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. METHODS: Online search of the PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science databases was performed. The endpoints of this review were to evaluate the efficacy of the agents in terms of complete response rates (CR) and durability of CR, overall survival, recurrence-free survival and cancer-specific survival and to report on their toxicity profile. A search on Clinicaltrials.gov was performed to identify ongoing clinical trials. RESULTS: 14 studies were included in this review. The critical clinical need for the development of an effective, safe and durable intravesical drug for the salvage treatment of high-risk NMIBC seems to be met mainly by intravesical gene therapy; in fact, data support the FDA-approved nadofaragene firadenovec as a potentially important therapeutic advancement in this context. Promising results are also being obtained by the combination of N-803/BCG and by innovative drug delivery systems. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the plethora of novel intravesical treatments that have completed phase II evaluation, one can reasonably expect that clinicians will soon have at their disposal new agents and treatment options for BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. In the near future, it will be up to the urologist to identify, for each specific patient, the right agent to use, based on safety, results and cost-effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "The Malagasy frog Platypelis mavomavo from Ambolokopatrika in the North East of Madagascar was originally diagnosed based on its bright yellow venter, but only limited information on this species has become available after its initial description in 2003. Several Platypelis specimens with yellow ventral color have been erroneously assigned to this species due to a lack of DNA sequences from the P. mavomavo type series. On the other hand, the candidate species Platypelis sp. Ca10 from Andranomapanga in the Northern Central East of Madagascar with gray ventral color has been defined based on its genetic differentiation from other nominal Platypelis species. Here we study the genetic variation of P. mavomavo and P. sp. Ca10 based on mitochondrial (16S rRNA) and nuclear-encoded (RAG-1) genes, including a newly determined sequence from the P. mavomavo holotype, which was studied using a museomics approach. We find only limited genetic variation among the samples studied, and this variation is unlinked to ventral coloration but instead reflects geographic distribution. We, therefore, conclude that P. sp. Ca10 is a gray-colored variant of P. mavomavo, and that P. mavomavo is rather widespread in the North East and Northern Central East of Madagascar, with populations in areas bordering the North West (Ambohitantely) and Sambirano (Ampotsidy) geographic regions, and the yellow-bellied morph restricted to the North East (Makira, Ambolokopatrika). Due to the range extension of P. mavomavo, the conservation status of the species requires re-assessment.",

        "abstract": "Caveolin-1 (CAV1) is a membrane-bound protein that suppresses tumor development yet also promotes metastasis. E-cadherin is important in CAV1-dependent tumor suppression and prevents CAV1-enhanced lung metastasis. Here, we used murine B16F10 and human A375 melanoma cells with low levels of endogenous CAV1 and E-cadherin to unravel how co-expression of E-cadherin modulates CAV1 function in vitro and in vivo in WT C57BL/6 or Rag-/- immunodeficient mice and how a pro-inflammatory environment generated by treating cells with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) alters CAV1 function in the presence of E-cadherin. CAV1 expression augmented migration, invasion, and metastasis of melanoma cells, and these effects were abolished via transient co-expression of E-cadherin. Importantly, exposure of cells to PGE2 reverted the effects of E-cadherin expression and increased CAV1 phosphorylation on tyrosine-14 and metastasis. Moreover, PGE2 administration blocked the ability of the CAV1/E-cadherin complex to prevent tumor formation. Therefore, our results support the notion that PGE2 can override the tumor suppressor potential of the E-cadherin/CAV1 complex and that CAV1 released from the complex is phosphorylated on tyrosine-14 and promotes migration/invasion/metastasis. These observations provide direct evidence showing how a pro-inflammatory environment caused here via PGE2 administration can convert a potent tumor suppressor complex into a promoter of malignant cell behavior.",

E-cadherin is important in CAV1-dependent tumor suppression and prevents CAV1-enhanced lung metastasis. Here, we used murine B16F10 and human A375 melanoma cells with low levels of endogenous CAV1 and E-cadherin to unravel how co-expression of E-cadherin modulates CAV1 function in vitro and in vivo in WT C57BL/6 or Rag-/- immunodeficient mice and how a pro-inflammatory environment generated by treating cells with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) alters CAV1 function in the presence of E-cadherin. CAV1 expression augmented migration, invasion, and metastasis of melanoma cells, and these effects were abolished via transient co-expression of E-cadherin. Importantly, exposure of cells to PGE2 reverted the effects of E-cadherin expression and increased CAV1 phosphorylation on tyrosine-14 and metastasis. Moreover, PGE2 administration blocked the ability of the CAV1/E-cadherin complex to prevent tumor formation. Therefore, our results support the notion that PGE2 can override the tumor suppressor potential of the E-cadherin/CAV1 complex and that CAV1 released from the complex is phosphorylated on tyrosine-14 and promotes migration/invasion/metastasis. These observations provide direct evidence showing how a pro-inflammatory environment caused here via PGE2 administration can convert a potent tumor suppressor complex into a promoter of malignant cell behavior.\nURL: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38069269/",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with deleterious variants in MYSM1 have an immune deficiency characterized by B-cell lymphopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, and increased radiosensitivity. MYSM1 is a histone deubiquitinase with established activity in regulating gene expression. MYSM1 also localizes to sites of DNA injury but its function in cellular responses to DNA breaks has not been elucidated. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the activity of MYSM1 in regulating DNA damage responses (DDRs) to DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) generated during immunoglobulin receptor gene (Ig) recombination and by ionizing radiation. METHODS: MYSM1-deficient pre- and non-B cells were used to determine the role of MYSM1 in DSB generation, DSB repair, and termination of DDRs. RESULTS: Genetic testing in a newborn with abnormal screen for severe combined immune deficiency, T-cell lymphopenia, and near absence of B cells identified a novel splice variant in MYSM1 that results in nearly absent protein expression. Radiosensitivity testing in patient's peripheral blood lymphocytes showed constitutive γH2AX, a marker of DNA damage, in B cells in the absence of irradiation, suggesting a role for MYSM1 in response to DSBs generated during Ig recombination. Suppression of MYSM1 in pre-B cells did not alter generation or repair of Ig DSBs. Rather, loss of MYSM1 resulted in persistent DNA damage foci and prolonged DDR signaling. Loss of MYSM1 also led to protracted DDRs in U2OS cells with irradiation induced DSBs.
