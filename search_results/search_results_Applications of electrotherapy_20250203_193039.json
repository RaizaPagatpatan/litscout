        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In glioblastoma (GBM) therapy research, tumour treating fields by the company Novocure™, have shown promise for increasing patient overall survival. When used with the chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide, they extend median survival by five months. However, there is a space to design alternative systems that will be amenable for wider use in current research. Therefore, we sought to establish a custom-built alternating electric field device to investigate the effect of electrode design on the responsiveness of cancer cells to this therapy. METHODS: A 96-well microtiter plate modified with an electrode array was fabricated to investigate its application as an in vitro alternating electric field device. This was initially performed with patient-derived GCE 31 and GIN 31 cell lines found in the core and invasive margin of the GBM tumour, respectively. We sought to establish the effect of the application of low-intensity (3 V/ cm) electric fields with an application duration of 4-48 h, using intermediate frequency (300 kHz) alternating currents (AC). To demonstrate that electric fields were entering the cell, GCE 31 and GIN 31 cells were treated with the inorganic, non-conductive zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NP), previously demonstrated to enhance the efficacy of TTFs. After a 4-h exposure to NP, cells were then exposed to alternating electric fields or currents and their metabolic activity was assessed. To better understand how the position and morphology of cells can affect cell therapy responsiveness to alternating electric fields or currents, GBM results were compared to those from the semi-adherent brain tumour cell line, D425. RESULTS: Contrary to previous findings, there was no significant difference between the GIN 31 and GCE 31 cells exposed to alternating electric fields or currents treated with or without NP compared to cells untreated and unstimulated. D425 cells exposed to alternating electric fields exhibited a pronounced metabolic increase (1.8-fold), while those exposed to alternating electric currents with or without ZnO had a reduced metabolism relative to the untreated control. CONCLUSIONS: The initial hypothesis for the lack of effect of electrical stimulation on the adherent cells was that, due to only a single pair of electrodes being used, the proportion of cells that were in the correct orientation for electric field effects was limited. However, the dramatic shift in cell behaviour of the semi-adherent cells shows that cell morphology plays an important role in the responsiveness of cancer cells to AC electric fields. This study highlights the lack of understanding of the complex mechanisms by which electric fields exert effects on cancer cells. We propose that, for the therapy to be enhanced for patients, research should first focus on the underlying mechanisms of action, specifically on how individual cancer cell types respond to this therapy.",

Findings reveal that LHA has the potential to be targeted for DBS application to treat a wide variety of disorders such as opioid dependence, obesity, and sleep disorders without significant adverse events.

Among various nonsurgical methods, the most promising clinical results have been achieved with photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy. Clinical data on electric/magnetic stimulation, pharmacologic administrations, and vibration forces indicate the need for further studies to improve their efficiency. This growing field will lead to a paradigm shift as we understand the biological response to these approaches and their adoption in clinical practice. This review will specifically focus on the impact of nonsurgical methods on periodontal tissues, providing a comprehensive understanding of this significant and understudied aspect of orthodontic care.\nURL: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39840535/",

        "title": "Effectiveness of non-invasive ultrasound-guided electrical stimulation of genicular nerves for chronic knee pain: A case report.",
        "abstract": "RATIONALE: Chronic knee pain is a common health issue that requires effective and noninvasive treatment. We devised a novel noninvasive approach using ultrasound-guided electrical nerve reactivation (ENR) in which ultrasound is used to identify the genicular nerve (GN). Then, transcutaneous low-frequency stimulation is applied for 10 seconds. The aim of this study was to clarify the pain-relieving effects of ENR on the GN innervating the knee joint. PATIENT CONCERNS: Patients had visited our hospital with the complaint of knee joint pain. DIAGNOSES: This study included 21 osteoarthritic knees from 16 patients with a mean age of 78.3 ± 8.5 years. INTERVENTIONS: Baseline measurements included the range of motion of the knee joint, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores for pain, and maximum knee flexion angle during squatting. A therapist conducted an interview to locate the painful area of the knee and then performed ultrasound-guided ENR by targeting the GN. OUTCOMES: The preintervention VAS score was 49.3 (95% confidence interval: 41.0, 57.5). Postintervention VAS scores showed significant reductions: 27.0 (19.0, 35.1) immediately after the intervention (P < .0001), 27.7 (22.6, 32.8) at 1-day postintervention (P = .002), and 29.0 (22.9, 35.1) at 1-week postintervention (P = .001). The knee flexion angle during squatting significantly improved from 108.1° (101.6, 114.5) preintervention to 121.9° (115.1, 128.7) postintervention (P < .001). There was a significant increase in flexion angle preintervention and postintervention (P = .02); however, no significant change was observed in the extension angle. In addition, no adverse events were reported. LESSONS: This study is the first to demonstrate the effects of ultrasound-guided low-frequency stimulation of the GN for knee osteoarthritis. Although the exact mechanism of pain relief is unclear, we hypothesize that alterations in neurotransmission, with or without endorphin release, may play a role. Moreover, ENR may improve nerve entrapment by causing contraction of surrounding muscles.This study demonstrated that ultrasound-guided ENR targets the GN and effectively reduces pain without complications. This treatment addresses the limitations of invasive methods, such as hydrorelease and radiofrequency ablation. Furthermore, ultrasound-guided ENR has diverse applications in diagnostics, physical therapy, and pre-exercise pain management and will greatly benefit patients and healthcare professionals.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nonthermal, pulsed shortwave (radiofrequency) therapy (PSWT) is a nonpharmacologic, noninvasive modality that limited evidence suggests provides analgesia. Its potential favorable risk-benefit ratio stems from its lack of side effects and significant medical risks, applicability to any anatomic location, long treatment duration, and ease of application by simply affixing it with tape. Even with a relatively small treatment effect, PSWT might contribute to a multimodal analgesic regimen, similar to acetaminophen. However, widespread clinical use is hindered by a lack of systematic evidence. The current randomized, controlled pilot study was undertaken to determine the feasibility and optimize the protocol for a subsequent definitive investigation and estimate the treatment effect of PSWT on postoperative pain and opioid consumption. METHODS: Within the recovery room following primary knee and hip arthroplasty, cholecystectomy, hernia repair, and non-mastectomy breast surgery, we applied 1-3 PSWT devices (Model 088, BioElectronics Corporation, Frederick, Maryland) over the surgical bandages. Participants were randomized to 28 days of either active or sham treatment in a double-masked fashion. The outcomes of primary interest were the cumulative opioid consumption and the mean of the \"average\" and \"worst\" daily pain measured with the Numeric Rating Scale over the first 7 postoperative days. RESULTS: During the first 7 postoperative days, oxycodone consumption in participants given active treatment (n = 55) was a mean (SD) of 21 mg (24) versus 17 mg (26) in patients given sham (n = 57): difference 4 (95% CI, -5 to 13), p = 0.376. During this same period, the \"average\" daily pain intensity in patients given active treatment was 2.4 (1.6) versus 2.6 (1.7) in sham: difference -0.2 (95% CI -0.8 to 0.5), p = 0.597. Concurrently, the worst/maximum pain for the active group was 4.6 (2.0) versus 4.7 (2.1) in sham: difference -0.1 (95% CI -0.8 to 0.7), p = 0.888. No device-related systemic side effects or serious adverse events were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Pulsed shortwave (radiofrequency) therapy did not reduce pain scores and opioid requirements to a statistically significant or clinically relevant degree during the initial postoperative week in this pilot study. These results must be replicated with a subsequent study before being considered definitive. Data from this preliminary study may be used to help plan future trials.",

        "title": "Recommendations for the Safe Application of Temporal Interference Stimulation in the Human Brain Part II: Biophysics, Dosimetry, and Safety Recommendations.",
        "abstract": "Temporal interference stimulation (TIS) is a new form of transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) that has been proposed as a method for targeted, noninvasive stimulation of deep brain structures. While TIS holds promise for a variety of clinical and nonclinical applications, little data is yet available regarding its effects in humans and its mechanisms of action. To inform the design and safe conduct of experiments involving TIS, researchers require quantitative guidance regarding safe exposure limits and other safety considerations. To this end, we undertook a two-part effort to determine frequency-dependent thresholds for applied currents below which TIS is unlikely to pose risk to humans in terms of heating or unwanted stimulation.

Using an in silico approach, we conduct multiphysics simulations of various tACS, DBS, and TIS exposure scenarios in an anatomically detailed head and brain model. By matching the stimulation in terms of the identified exposure metrics, we infer frequency-dependent TIS parameters that produce exposure conditions equivalent to those known to be safe for tACS and DBS.

While TIS holds promise for a variety of clinical and nonclinical applications, little data is yet available regarding its effects in humans and its mechanisms of action. To inform the design and safe conduct of experiments involving TIS, researchers require quantitative guidance regarding safe exposure limits and other safety considerations. To this end, we undertook a two-part effort to determine frequency-dependent thresholds for applied currents below which TIS is unlikely to pose risk to humans in terms of heating or unwanted stimulation. In Part II of this effort, described here, we draw on a previously compiled list (see Part I) of adverse effects (AEs) reported for transcranial direct/alternating current stimulation (tDCS/ACS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), and TIS to determine biophysics-informed exposure metrics for assessing safety.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Transcutaneous Electrical Acupoint Stimulation (TEAS) is a noninvasive technique that involves the application of electrical stimulation to specific acupoints on the skin. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of TEAS in alleviating postoperative pain after gynecological surgeries. METHOD: A systematic search of multiple electronic databases was carried out to identify relevant studies that investigated the use of TEAS for postoperative pain management in gynecological surgery settings. RESULTS: After screening and data extraction, a total of 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the meta-analysis. The results of the meta-analysis showed that TEAS was associated with reduction in postoperative pain intensity compared to control interventions, such as sham stimulation or conventional analgesics. However, this reduction was statistically insignificant (p > .05). Additionally, TEAS was found to be effective in reducing the consumption of analgesic medications and improving patient satisfaction with pain management. The assessment of certainty of evidence revealed a grading of low to moderate. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the findings of this meta-analysis suggest that TEAS may be a promising adjunctive therapy for alleviating postoperative pain in gynecological surgery patients. However, caution should be exercised when interpreting the results and making clinical recommendations based on the low to moderate quality of the current evidence. Further high-quality studies are needed to confirm these results and establish optimal treatment protocols for TEAS in this patient population.",

Few studies have explored patients' perspectives on using TENS in the post-anesthesia care unit. This study investigates patients' experiences and perceptions of TENS as a complementary approach to traditional pharmacological pain management in postoperative care. METHOD: Patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were offered TENS as an alternative to conventional pain treatment with IV opioids. Twenty participants attended telephone semi-structured telephone interviews a median of 12 days after surgery. Data were analysed using a thematic analysis according to Braun and Clark. RESULTS: Participants expressed that TENS provided reassurance and relaxation, calmed them, and gave them a sense of control over their pain. Participants perceived a greater degree of autonomy as TENS could be administered independently. They conveyed a preference for TENS, which they experienced as a safe and fast-acting alternative to opioids, despite its limitations in managing severe pain and rapid offset upon discontinuation. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study that describes patients' views on managing postoperative pain using TENS in the post-anesthesia care unit. This study indicates that patients desire alternatives to drugs for pain control in the postoperative setting. TENS has advantages, such as a rapid onset and offset and supporting patient autonomy, as well as drawbacks, such as being ineffective when pain is too severe. TENS could be included within the routine multimodal analgesia framework for person-centred postoperative pain management.

The utilization of intraoperative Transcutaneous Electrical Acupoint Stimulation (TEAS) in conjunction with anesthesia is expected to become an effective preventive measure for POCD in clinical practice. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature review focusing on the use of TEAS in the prevention of POCD during surgical anesthesia. We searched various databases for relevant literature, including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang Data. The synthesis of data was performed using RevMan version 5.4. RESULTS: Our meta-analysis incorporated data from 20 Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) involving 1549 patients. The findings revealed that intraoperative TEAS significantly reduced the incidence of POCD when compared to the control group [Odds Ratio (OR) 0.29, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.22-0.39, p < 0.00001]. Moreover, patients receiving intraoperative TEAS exhibited a significant increase in MMSE scores (MD 1.21, 95% CI 0.53-1.89, p = 0.0005). Additionally, intraoperative TEAS demonstrated efficacy in reducing the contents of perioperative serum S100β protein (S100β), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in patients, and the improvement of these indexes may be the potential mechanism of TEAS in preventing POCD.
